Calculator for buildings in factorio :D

arguments:
  Filename: name of .json file you want to use for the recipies

important things to know :)
  -raw materials like ores are just measured in how many you need per second because factoring in productivity would be painful
  -don't trust the oil processing stuff because doing that well would actually require me to do hard things
