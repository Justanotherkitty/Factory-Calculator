Calculator for buildings in factorio :D

arguments:

  Filename: name of .json file you want to use for the recipies

important things to know :)

  -raw materials like ores are just measured in how many you need per second because factoring in productivity would be painful
  
  -don't trust the oil processing stuff because doing that well would actually require me to do hard things

  -don't trust this at all actually I found a major issue and am too lazy to fix it lol
